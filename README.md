# üçØ ssh-honeypot

Second assignment for the discipline of Computer Security in the Computer Engineering graduation program at Federal University of Esp√≠rito Santo.

<br/>


## üóíÔ∏è Pertinent concepts and tooling

### 1. Honeypots

In computer security, honeypots are decoy systems designed to mimic real systems in order to attract cyber attackers. They serve as bait to detect, study, and mitigate unauthorized attempts to critical systems (like servers or databases for example) without putting real assets at risk.

Honeypots are categorized into two main classes: low-interaction or high-interaction.

#### Low-interaction

They simulate only basic parts of a system and can detect basic attacks. They require fewer resources and are easier to deploy but don‚Äôt provide in-depth data about the attacker's techniques.

#### High-interaction

Mimic an entire system or network, offering a full operating system and applications for the attacker to interact with. These provide more detailed insights into an attack but are more resource-intensive and more complex to configure and maitain.

#### Cowrie

For this experiment, we are going to use [Cowrie](https://github.com/cowrie/cowrie) to simulate a low-interaction ssh-honeypot, even thou Cowrie is capable of simulating high-interacion honeypots for telnet and ssh environments.



### 2. Protocols for remote terminal access

Protocols for remote terminal access allow users to connect to and manage remote systems over a network, typically through a command-line interface. The two most used protocols for remote terminal access are Telnet and SSH.

#### Telnet

Telnet was one of the first protocols used for remote access to command-line interfaces, and allows users to interact with remote systems as if they were directly connected. However, Telnet lacks encryption, meaning that all data, including sensitive information like passwords, is transmitted in plain text. This lack of cryptography makes Telnet vulnerable to eavesdropping and interception, leading to security risks. Due to these vulnerabilities, Telnet has largely been replaced by more secure protocols, mainly SSH.

#### Secure Shell (SSH)

SSH is used mainly for the same purposes of Telnet, but employs strong encryption to protect all data transmitted between the client and server, which prevents eavesdropping and interception, making SSH a secure alternative for remote access. Due to its strong cryptographic protections and additional features such as secure file transfers and port forwarding, SSH has become the standard protocol for secure remote connections, mostly replacing Telnet.

For this experiment, we are going to setup a ssh-honeypot, that is, a decoy ssh terminal with weak credentials (commom username and password), and with the help of Medusa, we are going to try and crack the credentials with brute force.


### 3. Bruteforce attacks

To make a brute force attack to a system means to systematically try all possible combinations of passwords or authentication credentials until the correct one is found. Brute force attacks become viable only if the attacker has a pretty good idea of the subset of all combinations that the credentials can assume, and it is not impratically big.

#### Medusa

For simulating a brute attack on the decoy ssh host, we are going to use [Medusa](https://github.com/jmk-foofus/medusa), and automated tool that allows us to easily create an test multiple credentials combinations based on patterns that we can define.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Run experiment locally

### Requirements:

- Docker ([Instalation instructions for each operating system](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install))
- Medusa ([Instalation instructions] (https://github.com/jmk-foofus/medusa))

Before starting, make sure you have all the requirements to run the project.

To check the Node.js version installed on your machine, run the following command:

```bash
node --version
```

> [!TIP]
> If your Node.js version is not 18 or above, it is recommended to use `nvm`, which allows you to install and manage multiple versions of Node.js on your machine.
>
> [Repository with installation instructions](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)


After installing Node.js, install Yarn package manager:

```bash
npm install --global yarn
```


### Running the application

Clone the repository locally. Then, navigate to the directory of the cloned repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mateus-sartorio/descentralized-pik-with-blockchain-frontend frontend
cd frontend
```

In the project directory, run:

```bash
yarn
yarn start
```

If everything went well, you are now running the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
