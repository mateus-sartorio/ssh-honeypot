## ‚öôÔ∏è Configure and run locally

### Requirements:

- Docker ([Instalation instructions for each operating system](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install))
- Medusa ([Instalation instructions] (https://github.com/jmk-foofus/medusa))

Before starting, make sure you have all the requirements to run the project.

To check the Node.js version installed on your machine, run the following command:

```bash
node --version
```

> [!TIP]
> If your Node.js version is not 18 or above, it is recommended to use `nvm`, which allows you to install and manage multiple versions of Node.js on your machine.
>
> [Repository with installation instructions](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)


After installing Node.js, install Yarn package manager:

```bash
npm install --global yarn
```


### Running the application

Clone the repository locally. Then, navigate to the directory of the cloned repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mateus-sartorio/descentralized-pik-with-blockchain-frontend frontend
cd frontend
```

In the project directory, run:

```bash
yarn
yarn start
```

If everything went well, you are now running the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
