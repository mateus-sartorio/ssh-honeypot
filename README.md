# üçØ ssh honeypot

Second assignment for the discipline of Computer Security in the Computer Engineering graduation program at Federal University of Esp√≠rito Santo.

<br/>


## üóíÔ∏è Pertinent concepts and tooling

### 1. Honeypots

In computer security, honeypots are decoy systems designed to mimic real systems in order to attract cyber attackers. They serve as bait to detect, study, and mitigate unauthorized attempts to critical systems (like servers or databases for example) without putting real assets at risk.

Honeypots are categorized into two main classes: low-interaction or high-interaction.

#### 1.1. Low-interaction

They simulate only basic parts of a system and can detect basic attacks. They require fewer resources and are easier to deploy but don‚Äôt provide in-depth data about the attacker's techniques.

#### 1.2. High-interaction

Mimic an entire system or network, offering a full operating system and applications for the attacker to interact with. These provide more detailed insights into an attack but are more resource-intensive and more complex to configure and maitain.

#### 1.3. Cowrie

For this experiment, we are going to use [cowrie](https://github.com/cowrie/cowrie) to simulate a low-interaction ssh honeypot, even thou cowrie is capable of simulating high-interacion honeypots for telnet and ssh environments.


### 2. Protocols for remote terminal access

Protocols for remote terminal access allow users to connect to and manage remote systems over a network, typically through a command-line interface. The two most used protocols for remote terminal access are Telnet and SSH.

#### 2.1. Telnet

Telnet was one of the first protocols used for remote access with command-line interfaces, and allows users to interact with remote systems as if they were directly connected. However, Telnet lacks encryption, meaning that all data, including sensitive information like passwords, is transmitted in plain text. This lack of cryptography makes Telnet vulnerable to eavesdropping and interception, leading to security risks. Due to these vulnerabilities, Telnet has largely been replaced by more secure protocols, mainly SSH.

#### 2.2. Secure Shell (SSH)

SSH is used mostly for the same purposes of Telnet, but employs strong encryption to protect all data transmitted between the client and server, which prevents eavesdropping and interception. Due to its strong cryptographic protections and additional features such as secure file transfers and port forwarding, SSH has become the standard protocol for secure remote connections, replacing Telnet for most modern applications.

For this experiment, we are going to setup a ssh honeypot, that is, a decoy ssh terminal with weak credentials (commom username and password), and with the help of [medusa](https://github.com/jmk-foofus/medusa), we are going to try and crack the credentials with brute-force.


### 3. Brute-force attacks

To make a brute force attack to a system means to systematically try all possible combinations of passwords or authentication credentials until the correct one is found. Brute force attacks become viable only if the attacker has a pretty good idea of all possible combinations that the credentials can assume, and their ammount is not impratically big.

#### 3.1. Medusa

For simulating a brute attack on the decoy ssh host, we are going to use [medusa](https://github.com/jmk-foofus/medusa), and automated tool that allows us to easily create an test multiple credentials combinations based on patterns that we can define.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Try it for yourself

### Requirements:

- Docker ([Instalation instructions for each operating system](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install))
- Cowrie ([Instalation instructions](https://github.com/cowrie/cowrie))
- Crunch ([Official instalation source](https://sourceforge.net/projects/crunch-wordlist))
- Medusa ([Instalation instructions](https://github.com/jmk-foofus/medusa))

Before starting the experiment, make sure to have docker, cowrie and crunch installed on your machine. For cowrie we will see how to setup and configure.

Firstly, clone this repository locally. Then, navigate to the directory where you cloned it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mateus-sartorio/ssh-honeypot
cd ssh-honeypot
```

Next, we need to run cowrie, and for this, we can choose between running it natively or throuh a docker container. We went with th docker container, and highly recommend you to do the same, as it much simpler, faster, less likely to run into any problems and it allows us to concentrate on the experiment itself.

Cowrie provides us with a docker image, that we can configured when creating a container from it. To do so, we can use some default configuration files that should be placed inside the `etc` volume in the cowrie container. For this experiment, we need only `userdb.txt`, that can be found inside `etc` folder of this repository (the `etc` folder is already mapped in the `docker-compose.yml` file to the right directory inside the container, so all cowrie configuration files can be placed inside the `etc` folder of the repository, and it should be enough to apply them correctly when the container starts). For our tests, we defined a `root` user with password `ewA9w`.

A list of all possible files and configurations that can be used with cowrie can be found on [Cowrie's official documentation](https://cowrie.readthedocs.io/en/latest/README.html#configuring-cowrie-in-docker).

To start you ssh honeypot, simply run the following command on the cloned repository root directory (make sure to have the docker engine running):

```bash
docker compose up
```

This should start your decoy ssh host, and you should be able to see all logs from cowrie right away.

Before we start using medusa to try and brute force the ssh session, we have to generate a list of possible passwords. Let's suppose that we (the hackers) somehow got the information that the ssh host password contains 5 characters (maybe some internal leak), in the following pattern:

> Lower case characters (@): qwe
> Upper case characters (,): ASD
> Numeric (%): 1234567890
> Pattern: @@,%@

We can create a file container all possible passwords that match the leaked pattern with the following crunch command:

```bash
crunch 5 5 qwe ASD 1234567890 -t @@,%@ -o ./wordlist.txt
```

The above command should create a file on the root directory of the cloned repository called `wordlist.txt`. A reference for how this file should be can be found inside the `reference-medusa-files` folder.

Before we can proceed to use medusa, we have yet to create a file containing all possible usernames that we want to try to bruteforce. You can find a template file with some possible usernames in `reference-medusa-files/username.txt`. Feel free to use other usernames, according to how you configured `userdb.txt` inside `etc` configuration directory.

We can then user medusa to try and find the password for some of the users with brute force. You should pass the `ip` of the machine that hosts the ssh session (`127.0.0.1` or `localhost`, since it is running on your machine), the usernames file, the possible passwords list, the protocol (`ssh`) and the port (`2222` is the default for cowrie).

```bash
medusa -h 127.0.0.1 -U ./username.txt -P ./wordlist.txt -M ssh -n 2222
```

If the right password is in the list of possible passwords you created, medusa should find it. It will be printed on your terminal, and you can then log in into the ssh session you just 'hacked' with the command:

```bash
ssh -p 2222 root@localhost
```

Since this is a decoy session, the commands you (the hacker) type don't really have any effect on the host, and everything that is executed in the session can be seen by the defender (also you) with access to the cowrie terminal.
